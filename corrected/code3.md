 GPT feedback: 
Good things:
- The function takes a string as input, not just an integer.
- A list comprehension is used to remove any non-numeric characters from the input string.

Bad things:
- Using eval() is not recommended, as it can run arbitrary code and be a security risk.
- The function returns the boolean True or False instead of printing out some sort of output or return value that a user can understand.
- The code is not very readable, and could benefit from more clear variable naming and spacing. 
- There are no comments or additional information included in the code, which makes it harder to understand.

Overall, the code works, but there are some potential issues with using eval() and the lack of clear output. The readability and structure of the code could be improved.
