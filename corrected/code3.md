 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The function takes a string of numbers as input and returns a boolean based on the product of the numbers compared against the input divided by 3.
- The code uses a list comprehension to filter out non-digit characters from string input using `isdigit()` method.
- Uses eval function to multiply the filtered string of numbers

#### Bad:
- The name of the function, multiply(), is identical to the name of the module.
- The function variable name is the same as the function name.
- Using eval can cause issues if user input malicious code or code that may result in an error.

#### Other:
- The function does not have any comments. As the code is relatively simple, the function does not require many comments. However, further explanation in the code would improve readability.
- The code could do with additional checks, such as if the output is an integer or if `int(num)` produces a ZeroDivisionError. 
- There is an unnecessary if else statement.
- This code does not follow best practices, which include writing clean and readable code for others to understand and using meaningful variable names.
