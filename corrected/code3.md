 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The function takes a string of numbers as input and successfully extracts only the numerical characters from it.
- The function uses the `join()` and `isdigit()` methods to manipulate the input string.
- The function uses the `eval()` and `join()` methods to multiply all the extracted numerical characters of the input string together.
- The function correctly returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the result of the multiplied numbers is larger than or smaller than the number that is inputted in the string divided by three.
- The function passed all test cases provided.

#### Bad:
- The function name `multiply()` is not very descriptive of what the function does, it may be better to rename it to `calculate()` as described in the problem statement or to something more descriptive like `is_result_larger()`.

#### Other:
- The function could benefit from commenting to explain what each block of code does.
- Instead of using `eval()` to multiply the numerical characters, the function could use a loop to iterate through each character and keep a running product of the numerical characters encountered. This may be more efficient.
- The function should include error handling to handle cases where an empty string is provided as input.
