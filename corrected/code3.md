 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The function input parameter is descriptive and meaningful.
- The use of list comprehension to extract only digits from the input string is efficient.
- The use of the `eval()` function to multiply the digits is clever.

#### Bad:
- The function is named the same as the input parameter, which can be confusing.
- Function is only one line which makes it harder to read and debug.
- The use of `eval()` function can be dangerous and slow when used with untrusted input.

#### Other:
- The conditional statement can be written as a single line instead of using an if-else statement.
- Consider using a try-except block to catch non-digit inputs instead of ignoring them. 
- Comments explaining the function's purpose and usage would improve readability.
- The function could benefit from more comprehensive tests.
