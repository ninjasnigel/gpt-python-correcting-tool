 ### GPT feedback: 
#### Good:
- The program uses a single function, `multiply()`, to perform the necessary calculations and comparisons.
- The function uses a list comprehension to filter out non-digit characters before processing the string.
- The function uses `eval()` to perform the multiplication operation on a list of digits.

#### Bad:
- The function name, `multiply()`, is not very descriptive of what the function actually does. 
- The function does not handle input validation, and non-numeric characters are simply removed from the string without any warning or error message. 
- The function uses a ternary operator (i.e. `True if ... else False`) unnecessarily instead of returning the result of the comparison directly.

#### Readability:
- Overall, the code is relatively easy to read and understand due to the simplicity of the `multiply()` function. 
- The list comprehension used to remove non-digit characters might be difficult to understand for beginners.

#### Efficiency:
- The code appears to be relatively efficient, since the `join()` method and `eval()` function are only called once each.

#### Structure/Style:
- The code follows PEP 8 style guidelines for the most part, with consistent indentation, use of whitespace, and appropriate function naming conventions.
- However, the variable name `num` used in the `multiply()` function could be more informative - it's not immediately clear what the variable represents without reading the code more carefully. 
- The comment delimiters used in the code (`#--#`) are unconventional and could be confusing to someone not familiar with them.
