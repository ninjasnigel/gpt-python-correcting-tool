 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The function takes a string input and removes non numerical characters, making it flexible for various inputs.
- The function uses list comprehension to remove non numerical characters, making it concise and efficient.

#### Bad:
- The input parameter for the function is named poorly as it uses the keyword 'str' which is also a built-in function in Python. This can cause naming conflicts and confusion.
- The eval() function is used to multiply the numbers in the string which is not encouraged, as it can be a security vulnerability if user input is directly evaluated.

#### Other:
- The function should have proper documentation and comments to explain the purpose and inner workings of the code for readability and maintainability.
