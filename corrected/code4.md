 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The code is well-structured and easy to follow.
- The function uses helper functions to break down the logic and make the code more readable.
- The code handles non-numeric characters correctly by ignoring them.

#### Bad:
- The function name is not good. Using `str` as a variable name is not recommended since it is also a built-in type.
- The `fix_str` function can be simplified by using a list comprehension instead of a for loop.
- The function does not handle negative numbers. The prompt does not mention negative numbers, but it is always good to consider edge cases.
- The function does not account for the possibility of an overflow when multiplying the digits of very large input strings.

#### Other:
- It would be better to use more descriptive names for the variables and functions, which would make the code easier to understand.
