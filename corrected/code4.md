 ### GPT feedback: 
#### Good:
- The code is well structured and divided into appropriate functions.
- The variable names are descriptive and easy to understand.
- The function names are appropriate and convey their purpose.
- The code handles non-numeric characters in the input string appropriately by ignoring them.
- The program returns the correct output for all test cases.

#### Bad:
- None of the functions have any comments or documentation making it a bit difficult to understand what they do at first glance.
- The `fix_str` function could be simplified by using a list comprehension.

#### Comments on readability, efficiency, structure, and style:
- The code is easy to read and understand.
- The variable names are self-explanatory and follow the snake_case naming convention.
- The functions are structured in a well-organized manner.
- The code is also efficient as it avoids unnecessary loops and checks.
