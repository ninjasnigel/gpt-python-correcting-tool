 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The code is well organized into separate functions for different sub-tasks, which makes it easy to read and debug.
- The code checks for non-numerical characters and ignores them, as required by the problem statement.
- The code returns False if the input string has no valid numerical characters, which is a good way to handle invalid input.

#### Bad:
- The function name `multiply` is too general and does not clearly convey its purpose. A more descriptive name like `compare_multiplication_result` or `check_multiplication` would be better.
- The `fix_str` function could be simplified using a list comprehension instead of a for loop and if-else statements. For example, `fixed_str = ''.join([char for char in num if char.isdigit()])`.
- The function calculates the fixed string and its multiplication separately, which is less efficient than calculating the multiplication as we fix the string. A better approach would be to combine these steps into a single loop that calculates both at once.

#### Other:
- The code could benefit from additional comments to explain the purpose of each function and the overall logic of the program.
- The variable name `num` used in `fix_str` is misleading, since the argument is actually a string and not a number. A better name would be `num_str` or `input_str`.
