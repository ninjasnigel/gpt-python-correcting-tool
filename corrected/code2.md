 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The function name is descriptive and meaningful.

#### Bad:
- The function uses `eval()` function which is dangerous and not recommended as it could lead to code injection or security vulnerabilities.
- The use of `eval()` makes the code less readable and harder to understand, especially for beginners.
- The error message suggests that there might be a typo in the code, possibly `X` instead of `x`, but it's hard to determine the exact cause of the error without seeing the actual input.

#### Other:
- It's good that the code returns `False` if the multiplication result is not greater than the input divided by three.
- The function should have some input validation to check if the input string contains any non-numeric characters before attempting to multiply.
- The code could have better variable naming to make it clearer. `num` could be renamed to `input_string` or `numbers_string` to be more descriptive.
- It's better to make the comparison explicit with `>=` instead of using the ternary condition which makes it harder to read.
