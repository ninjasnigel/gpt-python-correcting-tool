def multiply(num):
    return True if eval('*'.join(str(num))) > int(num)/3 else False
#--#

 Test results: 
Student code :warning: **CRASHED** :warning: when running tests, the following error was printed : 

 name 'x' is not defined 



 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The code correctly checks if non-numerical characters are in the input and ignores them.
- The function name and input parameter name are appropriate.

#### Bad:
- The use of `eval()` is potentially unsafe.
- The code is not following the prompt as it should return True if the result is larger, not smaller than the input divided by three.
- The code contains a syntax error with the use of `str(num)`, which does not make sense since `num` is already a `str`.

#### Other:
- The function should have some kind of error handling if the input cannot be converted into an integer or multiplied together.
- The comments and code formatting could be improved for better readability.
