 name 'x' is not defined 



 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The code makes use of the join() method to concatenate the string of numbers together with * to show that they are being multiplied
- The code uses the eval() function to evaluate the multiplication expression.
- The code uses the ternary operator which makes the boolean expression more concise and readable.
    
#### Bad:
- The naming of the input variable is not accurate and may cause confusion to future developers who may want to make use of the function
- The code is not optimally efficient as it evaluates the multiplication of a string that may cause an overflow error
- The code does not have any exception handling capability that could cause the code to crash when incorrect inputs are passed to it.
- The code does not take special characters or float values into consideration.

#### Other:
- The function needs to have a clearer and more concise name that explains the purpose of the function and its output. Eg `check_if_multiplication_is_larger()` 
- It is recommended to use the try and except methods to handle errors and provide a better and more informative output message.
- It is recommended to add a comment stating the purpose of the function and the expected input and output formats.
- the input variable of the function should be called string instead of num.
