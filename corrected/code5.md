 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- None
#### Bad:
- The student did not follow the instructions given in the prompt.
- The code does not perform the intended task and the function returns False for all inputs.
- The function name is the same as the argument, which can create ambiguity.
- Instead of implementing the intended function, the student chose to print a message instead.
#### Other:
- The code lacks comments and variable names that can indicate the purpose of the function.
- There is no code formatting, which can make it difficult to read and debug the code.
- The code does not handle the error that occurs when the input string contains no numeric characters, which can lead to unexpected results.
