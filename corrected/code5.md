 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- None

#### Bad:
- The function defined by the student, `multiply(num)`, does not fulfill the assignment requirements or return the expected output for the provided tests.
- The `print()` statement included in the function is irrelevant to the task at hand and does not add value to the program.
- The function does not handle non-numerical characters in the input string as instructed in the assignment.

#### Other:
- It is recommended to choose a descriptive name for functions and variables that reflects their purpose in the program.
- The program does not have any error handling or input validation to check if the input is a valid string of numbers. It is generally a good practice to include error handling to prevent the program from crashing or producing unintended outputs.
