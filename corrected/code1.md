    prod = 1
    for digit in str(num):
        if not digit.isdigit():
            continue
        else:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod > int(num)/3

 invalid literal for int() with base 10: '9xaidcjhdsoicj99' 



 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The function uses a loop to iterate through the string input and check each digit if it's a number and to multiply them.
- The function has a condition to check if the input is a string of numbers, and if any non-numerical character is available, it ignores such character. 

#### Bad:
- The function uses "str" as its parameter name, which is not the most appropriate name to use since "str" is a built-in function in Python. It is recommended to use a different name.
- The function name is also "multiply," which could be misleading since the function should return a boolean value indicating whether the product is greater than the input divided by 3.
- The function doesn't handle invalid inputs well, such as a case where the input is an empty string. This could result in errors while running the function.

#### Other:
- The code crashes when the input string contains non-numerical characters that can't be converted into numbers using "int" function. The function needs to handle such invalid cases to avoid crashing.
- It would be better to separate the calculation of the product and the comparison from the loop using variables.
