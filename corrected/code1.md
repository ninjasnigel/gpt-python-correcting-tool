Student code: 

def multiply(num):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(num):
        if not digit.isdigit():
            continue
        else:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod > int(num)/3


 Test results: 
code1.py: Student code crashed when running tests, the following error was printed: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '3I33'

 GPT feedback: 
Good:
- The code handles non-numeric characters correctly, as they are ignored.
- The code uses a for loop to iterate over each digit in the number string.

Bad:
- The error message indicates that the code is not handling non-numeric characters correctly, as it is treating '3I33' as an integer and crashing. This may indicate a problem with the type conversion from string to integer.
- The variable name "num" is not very descriptive of what the input string represents. A more descriptive name, such as "num_str", would improve readability.
- The code only checks if the product of the numbers is greater than the input number divided by 3. It does not check if the input number is actually divisible by 3, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input number is not divisible by 3.

Readability:
- The code is relatively easy to read and understand due to the use of descriptive variable names and a clear and concise for loop.

Efficiency:
- The code is relatively efficient in terms of time complexity because it only needs to iterate over each digit in the input string once.

Structure:
- The code is structured in a function, which is good for modularity and reusability.

Style:
- The code follows Python's recommended style guide (PEP 8) with regards to indentation, spacing, and naming conventions.
