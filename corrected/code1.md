### Student code: 

#--#
def multiply(num):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(num):
        if not digit.isdigit():
            continue
        else:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod > int(num)/3

 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The code seems to handle the condition mentioned in the prompt, such as ignoring non-numerical characters.
- The code uses a loop to iterate through the digits in the input string and multiplication to find the product of the digits. 

#### Bad:
- The function name is same as the function argument name "multiply(str)".
- It's not a good practice to catch the error and print the error log in the function. The error log should be raised and handled in the caller's space.
- The function doesn't handle the case when the input string contains only non-numerical characters. In such cases, the program will crash with invalid syntax error as str() cannot be applied to a non-string object.
- The function doesn't handle cases when the input numerical string is empty.

#### Other:
- The code would be more readable if it includes comments to explain the purpose of the code. 
- The function should return True/False instead of 1/0 as it is more readable and consistent with the expected output. 
- The function should have input type specified in the documentation string. 
- It's always good to have some basic test cases included in the code to ensure its functionality.
