### Student code: 

#--#
def multiply(num):
    prod = 1
    for digit in str(num):
        if not digit.isdigit():
            continue
        else:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod > int(num)/3

#--#

 Test results: 
Student code :warning: **CRASHED** :warning: when running tests, the following error was printed : 

 invalid literal for int() with base 10: '3X33' 



 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The code has a clear and informative function name (multiply).
- The code uses a for loop to iterate through each digit of the string, which is a good use of looping.
- The code uses the `isdigit()` method to check if a character is a digit or not, which is a good way to handle non-numerical characters in the string.

#### Bad:
- The parameter variable name `num` is misleading since it's actually a string.
- The code doesn't handle the case of non-numerical characters that can't be ignored. This is shown in the test result with the string `'3X33'` causing an error when the code tries to convert it to an integer.

#### Other:
- The code doesn't have any comments or docstrings to help explain the purpose of the code or how it works.
- The `continue` statement is unnecessary since it only skips the execution of an empty line.
- The `int()` function is called multiple times, which can be slightly more inefficient than storing the result of the division first and using it for comparison.
