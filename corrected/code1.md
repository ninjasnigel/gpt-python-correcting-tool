    prod = 1
    for digit in str(num):
        if not digit.isdigit():
            continue
        else:
            prod *= int(digit)
    return prod > int(num)/3

 ### GPT feedback: 
#### Good:
- The code uses a function to perform the desired operation.
- The function uses a loop to iterate over the digits in the input string.
- The code correctly ignores non-numeric characters.

#### Bad:
- The function does not handle the case where the input string is empty. This can cause the code to crash or produce incorrect results.
- The function assumes that the input string contains only digits or non-numeric characters. If the input string contains any other characters (e.g., spaces), the code may crash or produce incorrect results.
- The function does not have input validation, which can be a potential issue if the input to the code is not well-formed. For example, if the input is an integer instead of a string, the code may produce incorrect results.
- The function returns a boolean value, but the requirement of the problem is to return an integer value (either 0 or 1).
- The name of the function does not describe its purpose clearly. A better name for the function would be `is_product_greater_than_third`.

#### Other comments:
- The code lacks comments to explain the purpose of the function and how it works.
- The code does not follow consistent indentation, which can make it harder to read and understand.
