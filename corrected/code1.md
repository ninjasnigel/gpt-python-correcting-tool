 invalid literal for int() with base 10: '3I33' 



 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The function checks whether each character in the input string is a digit and only multiplies the digits together, ignoring any non-digit characters.
- The function uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the string, allowing it to handle input of any length.

#### Bad:
- The function uses the parameter name `num`, which is confusing because it is actually a string of characters that may or may not represent a numerical value.
- The function does not handle cases where the input string contains leading zeros, which could cause incorrect calculations.
- The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty, which could cause errors when trying to divide by zero.
- The function crashes when attempting to convert the input string to an integer if it contains non-digit characters.

#### Other:
- The function could benefit from more descriptive variable names to make it easier to understand what each variable represents.
- The function could be improved by checking for the presence of leading zeros and empty input strings and returning an appropriate value or raising an error before attempting any calculations.
- The function could be made more flexible by allowing the caller to specify the divisor to use instead of always dividing by 3.
