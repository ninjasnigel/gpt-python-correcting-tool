### Student code: 

#--#
def multiply(str):
    product = 1
    for char in str:
        if char.isdigit():
            product *= int(char)
    
    divided_by_three = int(str) / 3
    
    return product > divided_by_three
#--#

 Test results: 
Student code :warning: **CRASHED** :warning: when running tests, the following error was printed : 

 'int' object is not iterable 



 ### GPT feedback: 

#### Good:
- The program accurately multiplies all digits in the string and ignores non-numerical characters.

#### Bad:
- The program crashes due to a runtime error in the implementation.
- The solution did not follow the prompt accurately, as it would divide the entire input string by 3, instead of the intended integer parsed from the string.

#### Other:
- The variable name used in the function is the same as the function name. It is generally bad form since it may cause confusion later on in the program.
- It would be more efficient to avoid casting the entire input string to an int and use a flag to check the presence of numerical digits.
